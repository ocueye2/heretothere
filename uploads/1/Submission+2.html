And relates to my theme as this innovation causes humanity to be isolated from each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;">This is shown to us in the quote &ldquo;and now every mother can chose the color of her child, that&rsquo;s not nature&rsquo;s way&rdquo; and&rdquo;</span> And now there is no sound, for we all live underground&rdquo;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;">. The first quote shows that the Monster is humans desire to innovate by telling us that we are messing with things that can have massive consequences for nature and therefore ourselves. the next quote proves that as when he says that they live underground. He is referring to how technology is isolating us from others. It could also have the more literal meaning of how an incident involving technology forced humanity underground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: black;">The second quote I have to prove this is &ldquo;Always seem to be governed by this love we have For useless twisting of our new technology &ldquo;This quote talks about how we get caught up in making more technology that we fail to take into account other important things like social issues, poverty, and the environment. This means the technology is a monster as it distracts us from fixing other important issues. This relates to my theme as this means technology isolates us from important issues.</span></p></body></html>
