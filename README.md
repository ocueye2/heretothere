# Here To There
## An easy way to transfer files
Here to there is a open source, self hosted verson I made of send anywhere. 

It allows you to upload files and retreve them via a code to easily. solving the problem of how to transfer your files from one device to another.

I made it because all of the options eather have ads, only work on the lan, or cost on a subscription basis. A nas also seems overkill for a problem like this.
